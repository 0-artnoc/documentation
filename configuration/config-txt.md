# config.txt

As the raspberry PI doesn't have a conventional BIOS, the various system configuration parameters that would normally be kept and set using a BIOS are stored as a text file named "config.txt".

The Raspberry Pi config.txt file is read by the GPU before the ARM core is initialised. 

This file is an optional file on the boot partition.  It is normally accessible as /boot/config.txt from Linux, but from Windows (or OS X) it is seen as a file in the accessible part of the card.

You can get your current active settings with the following commands:
```
 vcgencmd get_config <config> - lists a specific config value. E.g. vcgencmd get_config arm_freq
 vcgencmd get_config int - lists all the integer config options that are set (non-zero)
 vcgencmd get_config str - lists all the string config options that are set (non-null)
```

# File format

The format is "property=value" where value is an integer. You may specify only one option per line. Comments may be added by starting a line with the '#' character.                                                                                                                                     

Note: In the newer Raspberry Pi models there is # before every line. If you want changes to have an effect then 'uncomment', (i.e. remove the #).

Here is an example file:
```
 # Set stdv mode to PAL (as used in Europe)
 sdtv_mode=2
 # Force the monitor to HDMI mode so that sound will be sent over HDMI cable
 hdmi_drive=2
 # Set monitor mode to DMT
 hdmi_group=2
 # Set monitor resolution to 1024x768 XGA 60Hz (HDMI_DMT_XGA_60)
 hdmi_mode=16
 # Make display smaller to stop text spilling off the screen
 overscan_left=20
 overscan_right=12
 overscan_top=10
 overscan_bottom=10
```

# Memory

```disable_l2cache```	 disables ARM access to GPU's L2 cache. Needs corresponding L2 disabled kernel. Default 0.

```gpu_mem```	 GPU memory in megabyte. Sets the memory split between the ARM and GPU. ARM gets the remaining memory. Min 16. Default 64.

```gpu_mem_256```	GPU memory in megabyte for the 256MB Raspberry Pi. Ignored by the 512MB RP. Overrides gpu_mem. Max 192. Default not set.

```gpu_mem_512```	GPU memory in megabyte for the 512MB Raspberry Pi. Ignored by the 256MB RP. Overrides gpu_mem. Max 448. Default not set.

```disable_pvt```       Disable adjusting the refresh rate of RAM every 500ms (measuring RAM temparature).

## CMA - Dynamic Memory Split

The firmware and kernel as of 19. November 2012 supports CMA, which means the memory split between ARM and GPU is managed dynamically at runtime. 

You can find an [example config.txt here](http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=223549#p223549).

```cma_lwm```	When GPU has less than cma_lwm (low water mark) memory available it will request some from ARM.

```cma_hwm```	When GPU has more than cma_hwm (high water mark) memory available it will release some to ARM.

The following options need to be in cmdline.txt for CMA to work:
  coherent_pool=6M smsc95xx.turbo_mode=N

Note: As per https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/503 popcornmix states that CMA is not officially supported.

```overscan_left```	 number of pixels to skip on left.

```overscan_right```	 number of pixels to skip on right.

```overscan_top```	 number of pixels to skip on top.

```overscan_bottom```	 number of pixels to skip on bottom.

```framebuffer_width```	 console framebuffer width in pixels. Default is display width minus overscan.

```framebuffer_height```	 console framebuffer height in pixels. Default is display height minus overscan.

```framebuffer_depth```	 console framebuffer depth in bits per pixel. Default is 16.  8bit is valid, but default RGB palette makes an unreadable screen. 24bit looks better but has corruption issues as of 20120615. 32bit has no corruption issues but needs framebuffer_ignore_alpha=1 and shows the wrong colors as of 20120615.

```framebuffer_ignore_alpha``` set to 1 to disable alpha channel. Helps with 32bit.

```test_mode```	 enable test sound/image during boot for manufacturing test.

```disable_overscan```	 set to 1 to disable overscan.

```config_hdmi_boost```		configure the signal strength of the HDMI interface. Default is 0. Try 4 if you have interference issues with hdmi. 7 is the maximum.

```display_rotate``` rotates the display clockwise on the screen (default=0) or flips the display.
 display_rotate=0        Normal
 display_rotate=1        90 degrees
 display_rotate=2        180 degrees
 display_rotate=3        270 degrees
 display_rotate=0x10000  horizontal flip
 display_rotate=0x20000  vertical flip

Note: the 90 and 270 degrees rotation options require additional memory on GPU, so won't work with the 16M GPU split. Probably the reason for:
* Crashes my RPI before Linux boots if set to "1" -- REW 20120913.

##Which values are valid for my monitor?
Your HDMI monitor may support only a limited set of formats. To find out which formats are supported, use the following method:

*Set the output format to VGA 60Hz (hdmi_group=1 hdmi_mode=1) and boot up the Raspberry Pi.
*Enter the following command to give a list of CEA supported modes:
 ```/opt/vc/bin/tvservice -m CEA```
*Enter the following command to give a list of DMT supported modes:
 ```/opt/vc/bin/tvservice -m DMT```
*Enter the following command to show your current state:
 ```/opt/vc/bin/tvservice -s```
*Enter the following commands to dump more detailed information from your monitor:
 ```/opt/vc/bin/tvservice -d edid.dat```
 ```/opt/vc/bin/edidparser edid.dat```
The edid.dat should also be provided when troubleshooting problems with the default HDMI mode.

#Licensed codecs
Hardware decoding of additional codecs can be enabled by [purchasing a licence](http://swag.raspberrypi.org/collections/software) that is locked to the CPU serial number of your Raspberry Pi.

```decode_MPG2``` Licence key to allow hardware MPEG-2 decoding.
  decode_MPG2=0x12345678

```decode_WVC1``` Licence key to allow hardware VC-1 decoding.
  decode_WVC1=0x12345678

Licence setup for SD-card sharing between multiple Pis. There is a maximum of eight licences at once.
  decode_XXXX=0x12345678,0xabcdabcd,0x87654321,...

#Boot

```avoid_safe_mode```         if set to 1, [[RPI_safe_mode|safe_mode]] boot won't be enabled. Default 0.

```disable_splash```          if set to 1, avoids the rainbow splash screen on boot.

#Overclocking
```NOTE:``` Setting parameters other than that available by 'raspi-config' will set a permanent bit within the SOC, making it possible to detect that you Pi has been overclocked. This was originally set to detect a void warranty if the device had been overclocked. Since September 19th 2012 you can overclock your Pi without affecting your warranty<ref>[http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2008 Introducing turbo mode: up to 50% more performance for free]</ref>.

The latest kernel has a [http://www.pantz.org/software/cpufreq/usingcpufreqonlinux.html cpufreq] kernel driver with the "ondemand" governor enabled by default. It has no effect if you have no overclock settings.
But when you do, the ARM frequency will vary with processor load.  Non-default values are only used when needed according to the governor. You can adjust the minimum values with the *_min config options or disable dynamic clocking with force_turbo=1. <ref name=cpufreq>http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=169726#p169726</ref>

Overclock and overvoltage will be disabled at runtime when the SoC reaches 85°C to cool it down. You should not hit the limit, even with maximum settings at 25°C ambient temperature. <ref name=freq_overheat>http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=11579#p169872</ref>

###force_turbo mode
  force_turbo=0
Enables dynamic clocks and voltage for the ARM core, GPU core and SDRAM. 
When busy, ARM frequency go up to "arm_freq" and down to "arm_freq_min" on idle. 
"core_freq", "sdram_freq" and "over_voltage" behave the same. "over_voltage" is limited to 6 (1.35V).
Non-default values for the h264/v3d/isp parts are ignored.
  force_turbo=1
disables dynamic clocking, so all frequencies and voltages stay high. 
Overclocking of h264/v3d/isp GPU parts is allowed as well as setting "over_voltage" to 8 (1.4V).
<ref name=force_turbo>http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=6201&sid=852d546291ae711ffcd8bf23d3214581&start=325#p170793</ref>

##Clocks relationship

The GPU core, h264, v3d and ISP share a PLL, therefore need to have related frequencies. ARM, SDRAM and GPU each have their own PLLs and can have unrelated frequencies.<ref name=freq_relationship>http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=6201&start=275#p168042</ref> 

The following is not necessary with "avoid_pwm_pll=1".

 pll_freq = floor(2400 / (2 * core_freq)) * (2 * core_freq)
 gpu_freq = pll_freq / [even number]

The effective gpu_freq is automatically rounded to nearest even integer, so asking for core_freq=500 and gpu_freq=300 will result in divisor of 2000/300 = 6.666 => 6 and so 333.33MHz.

##Tested values
The following table shows some successful attempts at overclocking, which can be used for orientation. These settings may not work on every device, and can shorten the lifespan of the Broadcom SoC.

There are [http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=6201&p=159188&hilit=hynix#p159160 reports] that Hynix RAM is not as good as Samsung RAM for overclocking.


##Monitoring Temperature and Voltage 

To monitor the Pi's temperature, look at:  <code>/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp</code>.<br>
To monitor the Pi's current frequency, look at: <code>/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq</code>.<br>
To monitor the Pi's PSU voltage, you'll need a multimeter, to measure across the power supply test points, or the expansion header.

It's generally a good idea to keep the core temp below 70 degrees, and the voltage above 4.8V. (Note that some, not necessarily cheap, USB power supplies fall as low as 4.2V; this is because they are usually designed to charge a 3.7V LiPo battery, rather than to supply a solid 5V to a computer). A heatsink can be helpful, especially if the Pi is to be run inside a case. A suitable heatsink is the self-adhesive BGA (ball-grid-array) 14x14x10 mm heatsink, part 674-4756 from RS Components.

##Overclock stability test

Most overclocking issues show up right away with a failure to boot, but it is possible to get filesystem corruption that arises over time. Here is a script to stress-test the stability of the system, specifically the SD card. If this script runs to completion without any errors showing in <code>dmesg</code>, then the Pi is probably stable with your chosen settings. 

If the system ''does'' crash, then hold down the ''shift'' key during boot, which will temporarily disable all overclocking. Also, note that SD card issues are usually affected by the core_freq, rather than the arm_freq, and that there is a surprisingly big jump in this (from 250 MHz to 500 MHz) between the ''High'' speed (950 MHz) and ''Turbo'' (1 GHz) presets in raspi-config.

 #!/bin/bash
 #Simple stress test for system. If it survives this, it's probably stable.
 #Free software, GPL2+
 
 echo "Testing overclock stability..."
 
 #Max out the CPU in the background (one core). Heats it up, loads the power-supply. 
 nice yes >/dev/null &
 
 #Read the entire SD card 10x. Tests RAM and I/O
 for i in `seq 1 10`; do echo reading: $i; sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/dev/null bs=4M; done
 
 #Writes 512 MB test file,  10x.
 for i in `seq 1 10`; do echo writing: $i; dd if=/dev/zero of=deleteme.dat bs=1M count=512; sync; done
 
 #Clean up
 killall yes
 rm deleteme.dat
 
 #Print summary. Anything nasty will appear in dmesg.
 echo -n "CPU freq: " ; cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq
 echo -n "CPU temp: " ; cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp
 dmesg | tail 
 
 echo "Not crashed yet, probably stable."
