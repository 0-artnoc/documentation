# SSH (Secure Shell)

You can remotely gain access to the command line of a Raspberry Pi from another computer on the same network using `ssh`.

Note you only have access to the command line, not the full desktop environment. For full remote desktop see [VNC](../vnc/README.md).

SSH is built in to Linux distribtions and Mac OS, and a third party SSH client is available for Windows. See the following guides for using SSH depending on the Operating System used by the computer you are connecting from:

- [Linux & Mac OS](unix.md)
- [Windows](windows.md)
