# Setup / Quickstart

A quickstart guide to setting up your Raspberry Pi

## What you will need

### Essential (for general use)

- [SD Card](sd-cards.md)
    - We recommend an 8GB class 4 SD card - ideally preinstalled with [NOOBS](../installation/noobs.md)

- [Display & connectivity cable](monitor-connection.md)
    - Any monitor or TV should work as a display for the Pi - ideally one with HDMI input but other connections are available

- Keyboard and mouse
    - Any standard USB keyboard and mouse should work
    
    - Wireless keyboards and mice work if already paired
    
    - For keyboard layout configuration see [raspi-config](../configuration/raspi-config.md)

- [Power supply](../hardware/raspberrypi/power.md)
    - The Pi is powered by a USB Micro power supply (like most standard mobile phone chargers)
    
    - You'll need a good quality power supply that can supply at least 700mA at 5V.
    
    - Low ampage (~700mA) power supplies  will work for basic usage but are likely to cause the Pi to reboot if it draws too much power

### Optional

- Ethernet (network) cable [Model B only]
    - An ethernet cable is used to connect your Pi to a local network and the internet
    
- [USB wireless dongle](../configuration/wireless.md)
    - Alternatively you can connect to a wireless network using a USB wireless dongle, which requires configuration
    
- Audio lead
    - Audio can be played through speakers or headphones using a standard 3.5mm jack
    
    - Without an HDMI cable, an audio lead is necessary to produce sound
    
    - No separate audio lead is necessary if you're using an HDMI cable to connect your monitor as audio can be played directly through the display, but it is possible to connect one to have the audio played through other speakers - this requires [configuration](../configuration/audio-config.md)
