# Linux commands

Here are some fundamental and common Linux commands with example usage:

## Filesystem

### ls

### cd

### pwd

### mkdir

This makes a new directory, e.g. `mkdir newDir` would create the directory `newDir` in the present working directory.

### rmdir

The will remove an empty directory, e.g. `rmdir oldDir` will remove the directory `oldDir` only if it is empty.

### rm

This will remove the specified file (or recursively from a directory when used with `-r`). Be careful with this! Files deleted in this way are mostly gone for good!

### cp

This makes a copy of a file and places it at the specified location (essentially doing a 'copy-paste'), for example - `cp ~/fileA /home/otherUser/` would copy the file `fileA` from your home directory to that of the user `otherUser` (assuming you have permission to copy it there!). This command can either take `FILE FILE` (`cp fileA fileB`), `FILE DIR` (`cp fileA /directoryB/`) or `-r DIR DIR` (which recursively copies the contents of directories) as arguments.

### mv

This moves a file and places it at the specified location (so where `cp` performs a 'copy-paste', `mv` performs a 'cut-paste'). The usage is similar to `cp`, so `mv ~/fileA /home/otherUser/` would move the file `fileA` from your home directory to that of the user otherUser. This command can either take `FILE FILE` (`mv fileA fileB`), `FILE DIR` (`mv fileA /directoryB/`) or `DIR DIR` (`mv /directoryB /directoryC`) as arguments. This command is also useful as a method to rename files and directories after they've been created.

### touch

### cat

Lists the contents of file(s), e.g. `cat thisFile` will display the contents of `thisFile`. Can be used to list the contents of multiple files, i.e. `cat *.txt` will list the contents of all `.txt` files in the current directory.
