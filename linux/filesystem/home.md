# Home

When you log in to a Pi and open a Terminal window (or you booted to the command line instead of the graphical user interface), you start in your home folder, which is located at ```/home/pi``` (assuming your username is ```pi```).

This is where your user's own files are kept. The contents of your user's Desktop is in a directory here called ```Desktop``` along with other files and folders.

If you have files you would not like to lose, you may want to back up your home folder. Read more about [backing up](backup.md).
