# Contributing

Please observe our contribution guidelines before creating a pull request.

With the exception of typos and spelling mistakes (feel free to fix these and they'll be merged in), please observe the following guides:

- Always open an issue first. This will allow us to determine whether or not the change should take place. Explain your issue, and we will discuss it with you. If we agree the change is necessary we will mark it as TODO and will fix it when we get a chance, or we will allow a member of the community to supply the change with a pull request.
- Note that this documentation is intended to be a short and concise set of helpful resources aimed at the majority of users. We will only feature our recommended distribution, Raspbian, in detail; and in order to keep the documentation manageable we will not accept additions covering alternative distributions.
