# BCM2837

This is the Broadcom chip used in the Raspberry Pi 3. The underlying architecture of the BCM2837 is identical to BCM2836. The only significant difference is the removal of the ARMv7 quad core cluster and replacement with a quad-core ARM Cortex A53 (ArmV8) cluster.

The ARM cores run at 1.2GHz, making the device about 50% faster than the Pi2, with the Videocore4 running at 400Mhz.

Also see the Raspberry Pi 2's chip [BCM2836](../bcm2836/README.md) and the Raspberry Pi 1's chip [BCM2835](../bcm2835/README.md)
