# Attaching Raspberry Pi Official 7" Display to the Compute Module IO Board

**This document is a work in progress and is intended for advanced users.**

For the display to work with the Compute Module, the firmware needs to be October 23rd 2015 or newer (use `vcgencmd version` to check).
To work with the Compute Module 3, the firmware needs to be from October 2016 or later.

## Quickstart - Display Only

1. Connect the display to the DISP1 port on the Compute Module IO board through the 22W to 15W display adaptor.
1. Connect these pins together with jumper wires:

	```
	GPIO0 - CD1_SDA
	GPIO1 - CD1_SCL
	```

1. On the compute module, run:

	```sudo wget https://goo.gl/iiVxuA -O /boot/dt-blob.bin```

1. Reboot for the `dt-blob.bin` file to be read.

## Quickstart - Display and Camera(s)
This will enable `disp1` and `cam1`, with the option of enabling `cam0`.

1. Connect the display to the DISP1 port on the Compute Module IO board through the 22W to 15W display adaptor.
1. Connect the camera to the CAM1 port on the Compute Module IO board through the 22W to 15W camera adaptor.
1. (Optional) Connect the camera to the CAM0 port on the Compute Module IO board through the 22W to 15W camera adaptor.
1. Connect these pins together with jumper wires:

	```
	GPIO0 - CD1_SDA
	GPIO1 - CD1_SCL
	GPIO4 - CAM1_IO1
	GPIO5 - CAM1_IO0
	```
Please note that the wiring is slightly different from that on the camera page in using GPIOs 4&5 instead of 2&3.

1. For `cam0`, add links:

	```
	GPIO28 - CD0_SDA
	GPIO29 - CD0_SCL
	GPIO30 - CAM0_IO1
	GPIO31 - CAM0_IO0
	```

	(Please note this image needs to be updated to show two cameras, or have the extra jumper leads removed)

1. On the compute module, for display and one camera run:

	```sudo wget https://goo.gl/gaqNrO -O /boot/dt-blob.bin```  

  For display and two cameras run:

	```sudo wget https://goo.gl/htHv7m -O /boot/dt-blob.bin```

1. Reboot for the `dt-blob.bin` file to be read.

### Software support

There is no additional configuration required to enable the touch screen. The touch interface should out work of the box once the screen is successfully detected.
