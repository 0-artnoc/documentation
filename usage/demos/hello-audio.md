# Hello Audio

This demo just demonstrates audio output. It plays a sine wave which makes a kind of WOO WOO WOO sound.

```
cd ..
cd hello_audio
ls
```

Now run the green `.bin` file:

```
./hello_audio.bin
```

This will play the sound over the headphone jack on the Pi, if you're using a HDMI monitor you can make it output over HMDI by adding a `1` to the command.

```
./hello_audio.bin 1
```

The demo will run forever until you quit. To exit the demo press `Ctrl + C`.
