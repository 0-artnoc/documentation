# Scratch

Scratch is a visual programming tool allowing the user to create animations and games with a drag-and-drop interface. It allows you to create your own computer games, interactive stories and animations through using some techniques of programming without actually having to write code. Itâ€™s a great way to get started programming on the Raspberry Pi with young people. To find out more about Scratch, visit the web address [scratch.mit.edu](http://scratch.mit.edu) or see the [Computing At School Raspberry Pi Education Manual](http://pi.cs.man.ac.uk/download/Raspberry_Pi_Education_Manual.pdf).

## Getting Started

You'll find Scratch on the desktop of Raspbian and in the applications menu under **Education**. Once opened you will see a window like this:

## Make the Scratch cat move

The cat in the white preview window is an example of a **sprite** in Scratch. Currently the Scratch cat sprite is on a blank **stage**. Let's get the cat to move.

1. Click on the Scratch cat sprite.
2. Then click on the blocks palette and select **Control**.
3. Next drag a **When green flag clicked** block and place it on the scripts area in the middle of the screen.
4. Add a blue **Move 10 steps** block from the **Motion** blocks palette and connect it to the **When green flag clicked** block.
5. Now click the green flag icon in the top right hand side of the screen and see the cat move!
6. How would you get the cat to move further?


## Changing the way the Sprite looks

1. Click on your sprite to select it. In the **Scripts** area in the middle of the screen, click on the **Costumes** tab.
2. You will see that the cat has two costumes. click on Copy to make a third costume and a new cat costume should appear.
3. Select *costume3* and click on **Edit**. This will open the **Paint Editor**. Experiment with all the buttons and tools to find out what they do.
4. Next, draw some clothes on the costume and click **OK**. 
5. To switch between costumes, click on the **Scripts** tag and add the purple **Looks** block, **Switch to Costume**, to the other blocks and connect it.
6. Select *costume3* from the drop down menu on the purple block. 
7. Now run your program to see the costume change.
