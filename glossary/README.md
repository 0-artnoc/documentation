- **Overlay** – a boot-time or run-time patch to a Device Tree allowing a degree of configuration by the user; see our [official documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/device-tree.md) for more details, or run `dtoverlay -a` in a terminal window for a list of available overlays
- **PoE** - Power over Ethernet, a mechanism to power a device through its Ethernet connection. Raspberry Pi produce a [PoE HAT](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/poe-hat) for the Raspberry Pi Model 3B plus.
