# Having problems creating the SD card?

For the huge majority of users, the SD card is what holds all the software makes the Pi work. It needs to be correctly set up prior to using.

## Did you buy a preimaged SD card?

Some companies or Ebay sellers provide preimaged SD cards which can be useful for people who are unable to image the card themselves. However sometimes these SD card can be out of date, or have older software on them than the current release, and this can sometimes cause problems. 

It's perfectly OK to overwrite a preimaged card with a newer image.

## No idea where to start?

You need to install an OS image on your SD card (if is not preimaged). This is actually pretty easy, first, download the image you want, then install that image on the SD card. We have full instructions [here](../installation/installing-images/README.md)

## Don't know which image to use?

There are two main images on our downloads page. NOOBS, and Raspbian. 

TODO Choice here...??? What does the user actually want to do with their OS.

## Having trouble imaging your SD card?

If you have followed the imaging instructions and something has failed (this is very unusual), you can post the problem on our forums where there is loads of help available. See [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums)
