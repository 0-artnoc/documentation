# My desktop isn't right...

The Raspberry Pi Desktop ios a modification of the well known LXDE desktop. We have made some changes to make it easier to use, and also fixed some bugs. But things can still not qork quite how you expect.

What's the problem?

- I don't even have a desktop!
- Edges are off the screen
