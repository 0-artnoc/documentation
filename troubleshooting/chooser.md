# Which Raspberry Pi should I choose?

This depends on a number of factors, but for the majority of people the latest model will be the best choice.

- [I want the latest model](#i-want-the-latest-model)
- [I just want to try one out](#i-just-want-to-try-one-out)
- [I want the smallest form factor](#i-want-the-smallest-form-factor)
- [I want low power consumption](#i-want-low-power-consumption)
- [I haven't much cash, which is the cheapest?](#i-havent-much-cash-which-is-the-cheapest)
- [I'm going to use Raspberry Pi in another product](#im-going-to-use-raspberry-pi-in-another-product)

## I want the latest model

Good choice. The latest model is always the fastest, with the most features. The current top of the range device is the Raspberry Pi 3B+. Check it out [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)

## I just want to try one out

Great idea, and we would recommend the latest model as they are usually the easiest to use as well as the best featured. Here is what you [need](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)

## I want the smallest form factor

The smallest form factor of Raspberry Pi is the Pi Zero. This tiny little board isn't as powerful as our top of the range devices, but still packs a punch, as it uses the same processor as the original Raspberry Pi. Check it out [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/)

## I want low power consumption

Over the years the power requirements of the Raspberry Pi has increased to cope with the extra performance. This means older models are a good bet for low power uses, and they are all still available. However, the current Pi Zero uses the processor from the original Raspberry Pi so is a good option for low power projects. Check it out [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/)

For a table of power requirements of most models, check out our FAQ section on [power](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/faqs/#pi-power).

## I haven't much cash, which is the cheapest?

Easy. The Pi Zero is available for $5, but only in quantities of one. So if you want more you'll have to find the money for the slightly more expensive ZeroWH.

## I'm going to use Raspberry Pi in another product

You can of course use any of the Pi range in commercial products, but we do sell a specific model for incorporation in to your own designs. This is the Compute module. Available in two versions, the CM1 and the CM3, we recommend the CM3 for all new projects. You will need to design and build your own PCB to attach the Compute Module to. See [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-3-plus-32gb/) for more details.
