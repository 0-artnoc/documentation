# Which Raspberry pi should I choose?

This depends on a number of factors, but for the majority of people the latest model will be the best choice.

- I want the latest model
- I just want to try one out
- I want the smallest form factor
- I want low power consumption
- I haven't much cash, which is the cheapest?
- I'm going to use Raspberry Pi in another product
