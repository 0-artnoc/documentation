# I'm trying to install and use the x86 version

Because our Raspberry Pi desktop has proved so popular, we have released a version for laptops and desktops. This is a standard Debian Linux distribution with our desktop pre-installed, along with some application we also release with our Raspbian OS release for the Raspberry Pi itself. It's very low demand so can run quickly on quite low powered systems and can be a great way of reinvigorating older laptops and desktops.
