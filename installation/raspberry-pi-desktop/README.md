# Raspberry Pi Desktop for PC and Mac

The Raspberry Pi Foundation provides a Debian-based operating system image
for x86 computers with the Raspberry Pi Desktop skin found in Raspbian.
This image contains most of the programming tools and software found in Raspbian
and is intended to make these tools available to people without a Raspberry Pi.

Users can install the image on a DVD or USB stick, and either use it as a
live disc (boot the OS without installing it), install it on their computer or
run it in a virtual machine.

The latest release of the desktop image can be downloaded from
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-desktop/
