# Installing Raspberry Pi Desktop on a DVD or USB stick

Once the image file (usually with the suffix `.iso`) is downloaded it needs to be be copied to the boot media.

If using a DVD (note, a CD does not have enough capcacity for the current image), then you will need to use DVD burning software to copy the ISO image to it. On Linux, the `brassero` application can do this, or if using Ubuntu or a derivative, you can use the `Startup disk creator` application. Both these are self explanatory. Windows (since Windows 7) has a built in image burning tool. Right click in the ISO image file and select the burn option.

To install the image on an USB stick, you use a similar procedure to burning a SD card for use on a Raspberry Pi. If not already installed, downlaod the `Etcher` application for either Linux or Windows depending on your host OS. Run it, select the ISO image file, and the destination device (your USB or SD card), and click the Flash button.

Burning an images can take quite a few minutes.
